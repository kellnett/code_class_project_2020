##This is an interval timing task
###There are three possible intervals (3, 6 or 12 seconds) and the participant must press any key when they perceive the interval has passed. If no response is made, the timing portion cuts off at 30" and returns -1 for a RT.

####Some trials are 'white' and some are 'rainbow'. White trials just display the fixation point during the timing interval.  Rainbow trials display a changing background color through the timing interval.  The participant must report the color of the screen at the end of the interval (that they still signal with a key press). There are different starting colors for rainbow trials so intervals and colors associated do not become predictive.

####At the end of each trial the participant is also display a rating scale, where they report how well they think they timed the task (Early, Close or Late). This is mostly as a distraction between trials

#####File fun.py contains all the functions necessary to run runTask.py

#####runTask.py will call functions and run the task.
